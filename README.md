# Hello-world

Hello everyone!
This is my first time to story code/pieces/document... everything on githut. It is interesting to try github although I used git before past 6 years. I hope that I can hand on github,even github desktop in a short time.

A question: if I copy a reporsitory URL from github web, how to clone it in github desktop?
